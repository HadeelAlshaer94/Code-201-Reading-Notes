##### Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create. A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy. To see how to use chart.js we’re going to create a set of 3 graphs; one will show the number of buyers a fictional product has over the course of 6 months, this will be a line chart; the second will show which countries the customers come from, this will be the pie chart; finally we’ll use a bar chart to show profit over the period.

### Setting up
##### The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js. Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you’ll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Chart.js demo</title>
        <script src='Chart.min.js'></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
``` 

### Drawing a line chart
##### To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart. So add this to the body of our HTML page:

```html
<canvas id="buyers" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
```

##### Next, we need to write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas, so add this to the foot of your body element:

```html
<script>
    var buyers = document.getElementById('buyers').getContext('2d');
    new Chart(buyers).Line(buyerData);
</script>
```

##### Inside the same script tags we need to create our data, in this instance it’s an object that contains labels for the base of our chart and datasets to describe the values on the chart. Add this immediately above the line that begins ‘var buyers=’:

```html
var buyerData = {
	labels : ["January","February","March","April","May","June"],
	datasets : [
		{
			fillColor : "rgba(172,194,132,0.4)",
			strokeColor : "#ACC26D",
			pointColor : "#fff",
			pointStrokeColor : "#9DB86D",
			data : [203,156,99,251,305,247]
		}
	]
}
```


### Drawing a pie chart
##### Our line chart is complete, so let’s move on to our pie chart. First, we need the canvas element:

```html
<canvas id="countries" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
```

##### Next, we need to get the context and to instantiate the chart:

```html
var countries= document.getElementById("countries").getContext("2d");
new Chart(countries).Pie(pieData, pieOptions);
```


##### You’ll notice that this time, we are going to supply some options to the chart. Next we need to create the data. This data is a little different to the line chart because the pie chart is simpler, we just need to supply a value and a color for each section:

```html
var pieData = [
	{
		value: 20,
		color:"#878BB6"
	},
	{
		value : 40,
		color : "#4ACAB4"
	},
	{
		value : 10,
		color : "#FF8153"
	},
	{
		value : 30,
		color : "#FFEA88"
	}
];
```

### Drawing a bar chart
##### Finally, let’s add  a bar chart to our page. Happily the syntax for the bar chart is very similar to the line chart we’ve already added. First, we add the canvas element:
```html
<canvas id="income" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
```

##### Next, we retrieve the element and create the graph:

```html
var income = document.getElementById("income").getContext("2d");
new Chart(income).Bar(barData);
```
##### And finally, we add in the bar chart’s data:
```html
var barData = {
	labels : ["January","February","March","April","May","June"],
	datasets : [
		{
			fillColor : "#48A497",
			strokeColor : "#48A4D1",
			data : [456,479,324,569,702,600]
		},
		{
			fillColor : "rgba(73,188,170,0.4)",
			strokeColor : "rgba(72,174,209,0.4)",
			data : [364,504,605,400,345,320]
		}

	]
}
```

## Canvas
![canvas](https://www.zapbuild.com/bitsntricks/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/HTML-5-Canvas-Poster-21.jpg)

### The \<canvas> element
```html
<canvas id="tutorial" width="150" height="150"></canvas>
```
##### At first sight a \<canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the \<canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.

### Fallback content
##### The \<canvas> element differs from an <img> tag in that, like for \<video>, \<audio>, or \<picture> elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. You should always provide fallback content to be displayed by those browsers. Providing fallback content is very straightforward: just insert the alternate content inside the \<canvas> element. Browsers that don't support \<canvas> will ignore the container and render the fallback content inside it. Browsers that do support \<canvas> will ignore the content inside the container, and just render the canvas normally. For example, we could provide a text description of the canvas content or provide a static image of the dynamically rendered content. This can look something like this:

```html
<canvas id="stockGraph" width="150" height="150">
  current stock price: $3.15 + 0.15
</canvas>

<canvas id="clock" width="150" height="150">
  <img src="images/clock.png" width="150" height="150" alt=""/>
</canvas>
```

### Drawing shapes with canvas
##### Now that we have set up our canvas environment, we can get into the details of how to draw on the canvas. By the end of this article, you will have learned how to draw rectangles, triangles, lines, arcs and curves, providing familiarity with some of the basic shapes. Working with paths is essential when drawing objects onto the canvas and we will see how that can be done.

### The grid
##### Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or coordinate space. Our HTML skeleton from the previous page had a canvas element 150 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.

![grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Drawing_shapes/canvas_default_grid.png)

### Moving the pen
##### One very useful function, which doesn't actually draw anything but becomes part of the path list described above, is the moveTo() function. You can probably best think of this as lifting a pen or pencil from one spot on a piece of paper and placing it on the next. moveTo(x, y): Moves the pen to the coordinates specified by x and y. When the canvas is initialized or beginPath() is called, you typically will want to use the moveTo() function to place the starting point somewhere else. We could also use moveTo() to draw unconnected paths. Take a look at the smiley face below. To try this for yourself, you can use the code snippet below. Just paste it into the draw() function we saw earlier.

```html
function draw() {
  var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
  if (canvas.getContext) {
     var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(75, 75, 50, 0, Math.PI * 2, true); // Outer circle
    ctx.moveTo(110, 75);
    ctx.arc(75, 75, 35, 0, Math.PI, false);  // Mouth (clockwise)
    ctx.moveTo(65, 65);
    ctx.arc(60, 65, 5, 0, Math.PI * 2, true);  // Left eye
    ctx.moveTo(95, 65);
    ctx.arc(90, 65, 5, 0, Math.PI * 2, true);  // Right eye
    ctx.stroke();
  }
}
```

### Lines
##### For drawing straight lines, use the lineTo() method. lineTo(x, y) Draws a line from the current drawing position to the position specified by x and y. This method takes two arguments, x and y, which are the coordinates of the line's end point. The starting point is dependent on previously drawn paths, where the end point of the previous path is the starting point for the following, etc. The starting point can also be changed by using the moveTo() method. The example below draws two triangles, one filled and one outlined.

```html
function draw() {
  var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
  if (canvas.getContext) {
    var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

    // Filled triangle
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(25, 25);
    ctx.lineTo(105, 25);
    ctx.lineTo(25, 105);
    ctx.fill();

    // Stroked triangle
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(125, 125);
    ctx.lineTo(125, 45);
    ctx.lineTo(45, 125);
    ctx.closePath();
    ctx.stroke();
  }
}
```

### A fillStyle example
##### In this example, we once again use two for loops to draw a grid of rectangles, each in a different color. The resulting image should look something like the screenshot. There is nothing too spectacular happening here. We use the two variables i and j to generate a unique RGB color for each square, and only modify the red and green values. The blue channel has a fixed value. By modifying the channels, you can generate all kinds of palettes. By increasing the steps, you can achieve something that looks like the color palettes Photoshop uses.

```html
function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  for (var i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
      ctx.fillStyle = 'rgb(' + Math.floor(255 - 42.5 * i) + ', ' +
                       Math.floor(255 - 42.5 * j) + ', 0)';
      ctx.fillRect(j * 25, i * 25, 25, 25);
    }
  }
}
```

### A strokeStyle example
##### This example is similar to the one above, but uses the strokeStyle property to change the colors of the shapes' outlines. We use the arc() method to draw circles instead of squares.

```html
function draw() {
    var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
    for (var i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
      for (var j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
        ctx.strokeStyle = 'rgb(0, ' + Math.floor(255 - 42.5 * i) + ', ' +
                         Math.floor(255 - 42.5 * j) + ')';
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.arc(12.5 + j * 25, 12.5 + i * 25, 10, 0, Math.PI * 2, true);
        ctx.stroke();
      }
    }
  }
```

### A globalAlpha example
##### In this example, we'll draw a background of four different colored squares. On top of these, we'll draw a set of semi-transparent circles. The globalAlpha property is set at 0.2 which will be used for all shapes from that point on. Every step in the for loop draws a set of circles with an increasing radius. The final result is a radial gradient. By overlaying ever more circles on top of each other, we effectively reduce the transparency of the circles that have already been drawn. By increasing the step count and in effect drawing more circles, the background would completely disappear from the center of the image.

```html

function draw() {
  var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');
  // draw background
  ctx.fillStyle = '#FD0';
  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 75, 75);
  ctx.fillStyle = '#6C0';
  ctx.fillRect(75, 0, 75, 75);
  ctx.fillStyle = '#09F';
  ctx.fillRect(0, 75, 75, 75);
  ctx.fillStyle = '#F30';
  ctx.fillRect(75, 75, 75, 75);
  ctx.fillStyle = '#FFF';

  // set transparency value
  ctx.globalAlpha = 0.2;

  // Draw semi transparent circles
  for (var i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(75, 75, 10 + 10 * i, 0, Math.PI * 2, true);
    ctx.fill();
  }
}
                        
```
